            <p>
                Howdy! My name is Carlos Carrillo! Thanks for checking out my site. I am a filmmaker and photographer
                who has a passion for technology and coding.
                I’m from Houston, TX but love to travel and consider my home the world. My passion for film,
                photography, and technology started years ago when I was a kid.
                As a kid I would mess around with the tech at the house to see how it was all put together and how it
                worked. Once I was in middle and high school,
                I joined the robotics team where we competed in FRC and FTC. As for film and photography my dad and I
                would always watch movies together and I absolutely
                loved that, but as I got older that love turned into a curiosity of how they were made so I started
                teaching myself filmmaking in 8th grade. This led me
                to studying computer science and art once I made it to college.

            <br>
            <p>
                I graduated from Texas A&M University in December 2019 with a degree in University Studies –
                Architecture with minors in computer science and art. I am currently
                back at A&M completing my computer science bachelor’s and hope to start my master’s in Visualization
                soon after. While at A&M I have been a part of the
                Aggie Magic Circle where I learned to become a magician. You may be asking, “what does this have to do
                with film, photography, or development?” and the answer is
                quite a lot. The actual magic part is probably irrelevant most of the time, but the psychology that we
                had to understand and apply effectively to create good
                magic shows is very relevant. Knowing how the audience’s attention works allows me to use that
                information to guide the audience’s focus to where I need in my
                filmmaking, photography, and design of any software/website I may create.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As of now, I already offer digital media production services to clients and hope to include website
                development as a part of those services soon.
                If you would like to see what I’m capable of, feel free to explore the page. All videos and photos
                linked were produced by me and everything related to the
                site was coded and developed by me as well as any coding projects linked.

                    <p>I have a huge interest and passion for CGI, special effects,
                        and anything related to animation graphcs. This originates from watching movies as a kid
                        with my dad. As I got older my love for movies slowly turned into a curriosity for how
                        they were made. I started teaching myself the movie making process since 8th grade and
                        eventually I came to discover the world of CGI and all things computer generated visuals.
                        This was perfect for me because it was an amazing way to blend the interest in technology
                        that had slowly started developing with my passion for movies and that type of
                        storytelling. The goal for now is to eventually take the lead in major productions like
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imjd6fftkbo&ab_channel=FameFocus"
                            target="_blank">Marvel</a> films that rely heavily on realistic CGI and computer simulations
                        to make their
                        films come to life.

                    students of hispanic immigrant families
                    learn about and have the resources to navigate the world of higher education so
                    they can bring generational change to themselves and their past and future generations
