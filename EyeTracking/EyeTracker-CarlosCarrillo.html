    <h1>Eye Tracking</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Eye tracking technology, like gaze selection, uses infrared light and camera sensors to detect the location of a
        user’s eyes and track their movements.
        This allows the user to navigate a computer system by controlling the mouse and other parts of the user
        interface using their eyes.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <p>This allows people with rehabilitative and motor disabilities that prevent proper motor function to use computers
        for communication, web surfing, controlling 3rd party software, and other computer-based functions.</p>

    <h2>Who it's for</h2>
    <p>People with rehabilitative and motor disabilities like paralysis, repetitive strain injury, severe carpal tunnel,
        Lou Gehrig’s, autism, and many more.</p>

    <h2>Unexpected Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows more in-depth studies of consumer behavior</li>
        <li>Allows for better studies to be performed in combination with VR to create extremely immersive lab
            environments that were previously not possible</li>
        <li>Allows for a more immersive experience when doing things in a VR environment</li>
    </ul>
